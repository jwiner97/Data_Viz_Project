Team Name: Git 'er Done

Team Members:
* Jason
* Chelsea

* Robert

Datasets: 
* Friggin medicare thing we found: https://data.cms.gov/Medicare-Part-D/Medicare-Part-D-Opioid-Prescriber-Summary-File-201/6wg9-kwip/data

Questions and Charts:
* Question: Does the rate of opioid prescriptions per 100,000 people in a county affect the opioid overdose death rate per 100,000 people?
    * Opioid overdose deaths per 100,000 people/county vs. opioid prescriptions per 100,000 people/county
* Question: Does the amount of money that doctors in an area receive from opioid companies in a county affect the opioid overdose death rate?
    * 
* Question: What are the education level rates in each county and does this affect opioid overdose deaths?
* Question: Do income levels in a county affect the opioid overdose death rate?
    * Per capita income/county vs. opioid overdoses/county and poverty rates


* Idea: final chart could be changes over time in SD County
